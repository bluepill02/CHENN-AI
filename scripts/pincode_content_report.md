## Samples and Details

## Data Quality Suggestions
- Manually verify a sample of central and outer pincodes, especially keys with many stops or unexpected names.
- Normalize common abbreviations (e.g., "Rd" vs "Road", "St" vs "Street") if desired.
- Optionally align this dataset to an authoritative postal or transit stops dataset for full validation.
